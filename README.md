# Pneumonia Detection Using X-Ray

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to detect pneumonia from X-ray images.

## Code Explanation

This repository includes a comprehensive approach to building a machine learning model for pneumonia detection. The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts and notebooks for cleaning and preparing the X-ray image data.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of various machine learning and deep learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics and techniques to assess model performance.
- **Deployment**: Code for deploying the model as a web application or API.

## Functions

The main functions implemented in this project include:

- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques to augment the training data, such as rotation, flipping, and scaling.
- **Model Architecture**: Custom neural network architectures tailored for image classification tasks.
- **Training**: Functions to train the model using the prepared dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Functions to evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Inference**: Functions to make predictions on new X-ray images.

## Run the Code

To run the code for this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/subhamrexpaul/Pneumonia_Detection_Using_X-Ray.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Pneumonia_Detection_Using_X-Ray
    ```
3. Set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the data preprocessing script:
    ```sh
    python preprocess.py
    ```
5. Train the model:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
6. Evaluate the model:
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py
    ```
7. (Optional) Deploy the model:
    ```sh
    python deploy.py
    ```
